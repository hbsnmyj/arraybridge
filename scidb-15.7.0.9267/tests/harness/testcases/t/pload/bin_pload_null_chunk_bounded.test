# This test covers the system behavior when one of the instances loads a file with all
# nulls into a bounded array.
#
# Inner workings of the entire test are contained within the shell script sh_pload_null_chunk.sh.
# which accepts parameters.  The script tests a 360x360 matrix loaded into a bounded array.  One
# of the instances loads a file that contains only nulls for data.
