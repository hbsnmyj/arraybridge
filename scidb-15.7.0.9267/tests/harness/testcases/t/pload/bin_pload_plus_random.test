# This test covers the system behavior when one of the instances loads a slightly larger
# file (+-10% of the flat array chunk size) during the parallel load.  This tests loads the
# data via pipes (fifos) into an unbounded array.
#
# Inner workings of the entire test are contained within the shell script sh_pload_add_remove.sh.
# which accepts parameters.  The script tests a 360x360 matrix with data that could be +-10% of
# the chunk size.  The data is loaded into an unbounded array.
