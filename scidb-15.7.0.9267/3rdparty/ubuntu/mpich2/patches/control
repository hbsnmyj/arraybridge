Description: Implementation of the MPI Message Passing Interface standard
 MPICH2 is a high-performance and widely portable implementation of the
 Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard (both MPI-1 and MPI-2). It
 efficiently supports different computation and communication platforms
 including commodity clusters, SMPs, massively parallel systems, and
 high-speed networks.
 .
 This package includes the program binaries necessary to run MPICH2 programs.

Description: Development files for MPICH2
 MPICH2 is a high-performance and widely portable implementation of the
 Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard (both MPI-1 and MPI-2). It
 efficiently supports different computation and communication platforms
 including commodity clusters, SMPs, massively parallel systems, and
 high-speed networks.
 .
 This package includes the MPICH2 headers and static libraries, as well
 as the compiler wrappers needed to build MPICH2 programs.

#Description: Analysis tools for MPICH2 programs
# This is an implementation of the Message-Passing Interface (MPI). The goals of
# MPICH2 are to provide an MPI implementation for important platforms, including 
# clusters, SMPs, and massively parallel processors. It also provides a vehicle 
# for MPI implementation research and for developing new and better parallel 
# programming environments.
# .
# This package includes the MPE environment, which provides a complete suite of 
# analysis tools for MPI programs based on port processing approach.
