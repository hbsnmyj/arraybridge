 *
 *  @description
 *  When a query involves autochunked redimension() operators, the
 *  actual chunk sizes (aka chunk intervals) cannot be known until the
 *  physical operator's execute() method.  At that time, the physical
 *  operator's _schema MUST be repaired using these actual intervals.
 *  Otherwise, the operator could produce a result Array with an
 *  autochunked schema---and that is forbidden: it breaks the "all
 *  chunk intervals are known at execute() time" invariant for the
 *  parent operator(s).
 *
 *  For a given operator, the derivation of the output array's chunk
 *  intervals may be arbitrarily complex.  Duplicating that
 *  LogicalOperator logic in the PhysicalOperator is a code
 *  maintenance nightmare.  But by using this AutochunkFixer class
 *  appropriate, a logical operator can record the derivations of
 *  output intervals and transmit them to PhyiscalOperators on the
 *  workers.  The workers can then build their own AutochunkFixer from
 *  the derivations, and use it early in execute() to fix their chunk
 *  intervals.
